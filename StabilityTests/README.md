# Stability regression checks

Run `dotnet run --project StabilityTests` from the repository root with .NET 8.
This builds TimberNet and links the production SteamSocket, SteamPacketListener,
and animation patch source. Steam and Unity APIs are test doubles; no game or
Steam client is required. Animation tests model a forward-only path cursor and
invalid visual coordinates, not a running Unity water simulation.

To compare against another checkout:
`dotnet run --project StabilityTests -p:SourceRoot=/absolute/path/to/checkout`

The separate RuntimeChecks executable tests the actual compiled mod's RNG
wrappers and save flags using the installed game's managed assemblies. It also
runs the actual managed UpdateWaterSourcesTask on a small overlapping-source
fixture, verifies identical results across six registration orders after the
ordering fix, and checks water diagnostic snapshots and field hashes:

```
dotnet run --project RuntimeChecks -- /path/to/BeaverBuddies.dll /path/to/Timberborn_Data/Managed /path/to/Harmony-directory
```

Both executables exit nonzero on failure. Neither verifies full multiplayer
determinism or executes Unity's native simulation. Build BeaverBuddies using
the repository's env.props setup before running RuntimeChecks.

Preview 4 also clones the installed game's depth-source modifier IL, substitutes
a controlled frame clock and depth-query stub, and exercises the production
timing transpiler. It reproduces frame-rate-dependent output before the patch
and checks matching ramp values after it. This tests the real ramp arithmetic
and emitted patch, but not Harmony installation inside Unity or depth sensing.

Preview 3 water diagnostic ZIPs can be compared with Python (no extra packages):

```
python RuntimeChecks/compare_water_snapshots.py host-water.zip client-water.zip
python -m unittest discover -s RuntimeChecks -p "test_water_snapshots.py"
```
